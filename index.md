#### Hello my name is Mahmoud Ahmed and i am from Cairo, Egypt.

I graduated from Faculty of Law Cairo University however i have been programing before graduating from it and i joined bread crumbs studio as a trainee. Once i have graduated i decided that i should follow my passion and get more involved in programing so i landed my first full time job at Epic Systems.

I have also passion with Automotive Photography and Gaming.

I am results-oriented software developer with more than three years of experience in development and overall more than 15 released projects. 

I make it my goal to create software with the user in mind, creating applications with a useable and intuitive user interface experience. I also understand the importance of creating highly readable and easily maintainable source code. I am constantly striving to learn new technologies and looking for ways to better myself in this rapidly changing industry.

My Motto: Where there's a will, there's a way.
